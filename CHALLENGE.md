## Problem: Atomic Design To-Do List App

### Objective

Create an interactive to-do list application using the principles of Atomic Design. Utilize TypeScript for enhanced type safety and structured code.

#### Requirements

[X] Implement the Atomic Design methodology in structuring your project. Divide the application into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

[X] Create a TypeScript interface for the task object, defining properties such as id, name, and completed.

[X] Design and style the application using CSS, focusing on Atomic Design principles. Consider the styling for atoms (e.g., buttons, input fields), molecules (e.g., task item), and organisms (e.g., task list).

[X] Include an input field to add new tasks.

[X] Display a list of tasks with checkboxes to mark them as completed.

[X] Implement functionality to remove completed tasks.

[X] Apply TypeScript for handling the logic of adding, marking as completed, and removing tasks.

[X] Ensure that TypeScript types are used consistently throughout the application.

##### Implementation

[X] Use Atomic Design principles to organize your project structure.

[X] Utilize TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

[X] Implement CSS for styling based on the principles of Atomic Design.

[X] Make the application responsive and visually appealing.

[X] Include a README file explaining the Atomic Design choices made during development and any other relevant considerations.

##### Bonus

[X] Implement local storage functionality to persist tasks even after the page is refreshed.

[X] Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.

[X] Allow users to edit task names.

[] Include lint or style configurations of your choice, such as eslint, stylelint, prettier, or other.

[X] Include unit tests using a testing framework of your choice, such as jest.
